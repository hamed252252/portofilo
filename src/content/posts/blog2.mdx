# Getting Started with NestJS and Prisma

NestJS is a powerful framework for building scalable server-side applications. Prisma provides an ORM that makes database management seamless. In this guide, we'll walk through the setup of a NestJS project with Prisma.

```

## Step 1: Set Up a New NestJS Project

First, you'll need to install the NestJS CLI and create a new project:

```
<CodeBlock language="bash">
  npm i -g @nestjs/cli nest new my-nest-project
</CodeBlock>
```

Navigate into your new project directory:

```
<CodeBlock language="bash">cd my-nest-project</CodeBlock>
```

## Step 2: Install Prisma

Prisma can be easily integrated into a NestJS project. Begin by installing the necessary Prisma packages:

```
<CodeBlock language="bash">
  npm install prisma --save-dev npm install @prisma/client
</CodeBlock>
```

Next, initialize Prisma in your project:

```
<CodeBlock language="bash">npx prisma init</CodeBlock>
```

This will create a `prisma` directory with a `schema.prisma` file, which is where you'll define your database models.

## Step 3: Configure Prisma with NestJS

To configure Prisma in your NestJS application, create a new service that will handle all database interactions. Start by generating a new service:

```
<CodeBlock language="bash">nest g service prisma</CodeBlock>
```

Open the generated service file (`prisma.service.ts`) and set up Prisma as follows:

```typescript
import { Injectable, OnModuleInit, OnModuleDestroy } from "@nestjs/common";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

@Injectable()
export class PrismaService
  extends PrismaClient
  implements OnModuleInit, OnModuleDestroy
{
  async onModuleInit() {
    await this.$connect();
  }

  async onModuleDestroy() {
    await this.$disconnect();
  }
}
```
